# Embed Button

You can get a public Instagram photo, video, Reel, or Guide post’s embed HTML code and use it to embed the post in other websites. Embedded posts automatically resize to fit their container, so they will look great on both desktop and mobile websites.

People own their Instagram content, so each embedded post gives proper attribution by displaying the post owner’s username and linking to the post owner’s profile.

## How to Get the Embed Code

To get a post’s embed HTML code using its Embed button:

1. **View the post** in a desktop or mobile web browser.
2. **Click the `[...]` menu** (usually located at the top right of the post).
3. **Click the Embed button** from the menu options.
4. **Copy the code**: This will reveal the post’s embed HTML code, which you can copy and paste into the website where you want the post to appear.

> [!TIP]
> By default, the post will include its caption. You can omit the caption by unchecking the **Include caption** checkbox before copying the code.
