You will need the following:

### Access Tokens

An Instagram User access token requested from a person who can manage comments on the Instagram professional account.

### Base URL

All endpoints can be accessed via the `graph.instagram.com` host.

### Endpoints

```
GET /<YOUR_APP_USERS_IG_ID>/messenger_profile
POST /<YOUR_APP_USERS_IG_ID>/messenger_profile
DELETE /<YOUR_APP_USERS_IG_ID>/messenger_profile
```

You can also use the `/me/messenger_profile` endpoints.

## Create Ice Breakers

To create ice breakers, send a `POST` request to the `/<YOUR_APP_USERS_IG_ID>/messenger_profile` endpoint, where `<YOUR_APP_USERS_IG_ID>` is the ID for your app user's Instagram professional account, and include the `platform` property set to `instagram` and the `ice_breakers` property with a `call_to_actions` array of `question` and `payload` objects.

### Sample Request

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
          "platform": "instagram",
          "ice_breakers":[
            {
              "call_to_actions":[
                {
                  "question":"<QUESTION_1>",
                  "payload":"<PAYLOAD_FOR_QUESTION_1>"
                },
                {
                  "question":"<QUESTION_2>",
                  "payload":"<PAYLOAD_FOR_QUESTION_2>"
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }' "https://graph.instagram.com/v24.0/<YOUR_APP_USERS_IG_ID>/messenger_profile?access_token=<INSTAGRAM_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

You can set a `call_to_actions` array for each locale you include.

On success your app receives a JSON response with `success` set to `true`.

### Sample Request with Multiple Locales

To create ice breakers for multiple locales, include the `locale` property and `call_to_actions` array for each locale.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
          "platform": "instagram",
          "ice_breakers":[
            {
              "call_to_actions":[
                {
                  "question":"<QUESTION_1>",
                  "payload":"<PAYLOAD_FOR_QUESTION_1>"
                },
                {
                  "question":"<QUESTION_2>",
                  "payload":"<PAYLOAD_FOR_QUESTION_2>"
                }
              ],
              "locale": "zh_CN",
              "call_to_actions":[
                {
                  "question":"<QUESTION_1_zh_CN>",
                  "payload":"<PAYLOAD_FOR_QUESTION_1_zh_CN>"
                },
                {
                  "question":"<QUESTION_2_zh_CN>",
                  "payload":"<PAYLOAD_FOR_QUESTION_2_zh_CN>"
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }' "https://graph.instagram.com/v24.0/<YOUR_APP_USERS_IG_ID>/messenger_profile?access_token=<INSTAGRAM_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

## List Ice Breakers

To get a list of your ice breakers, send a `GET` request to the `/me/messenger_profile` endpoint, where `me` is the ID for your app user's Instagram professional account, with the `fields` parameter set to `ice_breakers`.

### Sample Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://graph.instagram.com/v24.0/me/messenger_profile?fields=ice_breakers&access_token=<INSTAGRAM_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

On success your app receives a JSON response with an array of `call_to_actions` properties that include questions and payloads and locales, if applicable.

### Sample Response

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "call_to_actions": [

        },
